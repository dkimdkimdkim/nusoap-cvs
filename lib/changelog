2003-07-21, version 0.6.5
- soap_transport_http: SOAPAction header is quoted again, fixes problem w/ Weblogic Server
- applied Jason Levitt patch for proper array serialization, fixes problem w/ Amazon shopping cart services
- fixed null value serialization
- applied patch from "BZC ToOn'S" - fixes wsdl serialization when no parameters
- applied John's patch, implementing compression for the server

2003-07-22, version 0.6.5
- soap_server: fixed bug causing charset encoding not to be passed to the parser
- soap_fault: added default encoding to the fault serialization
- soap_parser: changed the parser to pre-load the parent's result array when processing scalar values. This increases parsing speed.

2003-07-23, version 0.6.5
- soap_base: fix code that overwrites user-supplied attributes in serialize_val
- soap_base: use arrays-of-arrays rather than attempting multi-dimensional in serialize_val
- xmlschema: emit import statements and qualify all elements with prefix in serializeSchema (better interop with validation tools)
- soapclient: get xml character encoding from HTTP Content-Type header if provided, e.g. text/xml;charset="UTF-8"
- soapclient: use headers in call if provided (previously ignored this parameter)
- soap_server: in parse_request, if neither getallheaders nor $_SERVER are available, use $HTTP_SERVER_VARS to get SOAPAction and xml encoding

2003-07-24, version 0.6.5
- soap_transport_http: apply patch from Steven Brown "if the server closes connection prematurely, nusoap would spin trying to read data that isn't there"

2003-07-25, version 0.6.5
- wsdl: apply patch from Sven to workaround single schema limitation
- wsdl: apply a variant of the patch from Holger to handle empty values for array by serializing an array with 0 elements
- xmlschema: remove the redundant default namespace attribute on the schema element; everything in xsd is explicitly specified as being from xsd
- soap_transport_http: fix setCredentials and add TODO comments in sendHTTPS about what to change if this setCredentials stays

2003-07-30, version 0.6.5
- nusoap_base: change documentation of soap_defencoding to specify it is the encoding for outgoing messages
- nusoap_base: only change &, <, > to entities, not all HTML entities
- soap_transport_http: update the Content-Type header in sendRequest, since soap_defencoding could be changed after ctor is called
- soap_server: use soap_defencoding instead of charset_encoding
- soap_server: read encoding from _SERVER if available
- nusoap_base: do entity translation for string parameters with an xsd type specified (thanks David Derr)

2003-07-31, version 0.6.5
- soap_transport_http: add proxy authentication
- soap_transport_http: build payload the same way for http and https
- wsdl: add proxy authentication
- soapclient: add proxy authentication
- soapclient: allow proxy information in ctor, so that it can be used for wsdl

2003-08-01, version 0.6.5
- soap_transport_http: close a persistent connection that's at EOF
- soap_transport_http: prevent conflicts between setEncoding and usePersistentConnection
- soap_transport_http: fix use of $headers instead of $this->incoming_headers in getResponse
- soapclient: improve handling of persistent connections
- soapclient: force xml_encoding to upper case
- soap_server: let the Web server decide whether to close the connection (no Connection: close header)
- soap_server: force xml_encoding to upper case

2003-08-04, version 0.6.5
- soap_parser: use XML type information to pick a PHP data type; also decode base64
- soap_server: read all HTTP headers when using _SERVER or HTTP_SERVER_VARS
- soap_server: add gzip encoding support for outgoing messages
- soap_transport_http: deflate is gzcompress/gzuncompress (cf. http://archive.develooper.com/libwww@perl.org/msg04650.html)
- soap_transport_http: clean use of persistentConnection so it's always a set boolean
- soapclient: add responseData member to access deflated/gunzipped payload
